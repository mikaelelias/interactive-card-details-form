The Interactive Card Details Form project aims to challenge my knowledge in using Html, Css, and JavaScript technologies by creating a form to receive credit card data.

The challenge consists of trying to get as close as possible to the layout available on the Front End Mentor platform. In this project, I applied some concepts in Html such as flexbox, absolute positioning, fixed and variable measurements such as px, vw, vh, %, em, and rem. The styling of the project was done with Css, where I used some interactive tools such as inputs, labels, and followed the color palettes of the model project. The biggest challenge in this project was the application of JavaScript, which is a technology that I have been delving into in recent weeks. The interaction of Js made the application even more dynamic by creating a simultaneous writing of an input on a specific ID and validating user information.
